            A knight was sitted on the grass of the battlefield waiting for some enemy to come, he was breathing slowly so relaxed,
            thinking about his love Mariangela, she was at his house looking after the children at that time, in the middle of his
            thought a warrior approcheas to him raoidly handling a large sword and when the warrior arrives to him swiped the sword
            with great force on his direction from left to right, the knight felt the wind that this warrior provoked to move
            towards the knight, at the time the swinging sword was about to cut his head on two pieces he moved his head downwards
            and inmediatly took his knife and stabbed the warrior in his belly at the same time that he grab the arm with the sword
            of the warrior to block a second swinging.</p>
       <p class="second">
        Jason was desperate on the fight, he banged his sword and rised his shield every second, sweated and covered of blood
        and mug he hitted his enemies with forced without stop, when he took down the last enemy near to him he saw a kid
        approaching to him with an axe in his hand, this kid was around 15 y.o., the kid had a look of angry and helplessness,
        he started to run towards him with a war scream rising his axe to attack, jason understood his angry, he had seen that look before, he thought that he
        maybe killed a relative of this kid, but he was not going to feel pity for him, they were in war and they were in
        a battlefield; jason tossed his shield to the kid as a distraction, the boy beat the shield aside with his axe, those
        seconds gave a great advantage to jason because make him to put near to the kit and hit him with the knob of the sword
        right in the face (just in the part between the nose and the right eye) the boy fell down, he dropped the axe with that
        blow, the kid covered his face with his arms to protect himself, but jason kicked him in the ribs, the boy ran out of
        air with that kick, then jason grabbed the boy's head and slammed it against the floor three times til the boy was unconscious.
